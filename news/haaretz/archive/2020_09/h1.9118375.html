      Meretz Chairwoman Tamar Zandberg said Sunday that "surrender to the ultra-Orthodox is much more than political. The farce of the 'red' cities is further proof that a prime minister accused of bribery is incapable of fulfilling his role." Zandberg added that "Netanyahu needs this alliance [with the ultra-Orthodox parties] to gain immunity from justice, and we will all pay the price in health and life."
     </p>
     <p>
      Avigdor Lieberman, Chairman of the  Yisrael Beiteinu party, said in a tweet that Israelis are "all hostages," adding "Due to the anger of the ultra-Orthodox parties, Netanyahu's alternative will still be a general closure" during the holidays. "Netanyahu is not afraid of God but of his representatives in the Knesset."

      The Former chairman of the coronavirus committee and Yesh Atid MK Ofer Shelah called on the government to "take calculated action - and to take into account the special situation of a city of 200,000 people, and the behavioral characteristics of the ultra-Orthodox population," referring to Bnei Brak after a meeting with teh city's mayor. "The worst thing is the hesitation, indecision, and action out of political pressure that characterizes Netanyahu's default government in every matter, and in this matter as well."
     </p>
     <p>
      Telem leader and former army chief MK Moshe Ya'alon also said on his Facebook page that "the fact that the citizens do not believe in the government and its policy in dealing with coronavirus, stems from mismanagement in general, and failure to tell the truth in particular." He added "in the first wave, political pressures influenced professional decisions, created a lack of confidence in the prime minister's professional judgment ... Government zigzagging, due to political pressures, is once again eroding confidence. The lack of trust also causes non-compliance with guidelines for the general public. Thus, there is no chance of defeating the virus."

      Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will propose softened restrictions, including a nighttime curfew, closure of schools and businesses in "red" cities – those with particularly high rates of infections – instead of a lockdown.
     </p>
     <p>
      The decision comes after Netanyahu delayed the meeting of the coronavirus committee that was expected to approve a total lockdown on "red" cities, five of which are ultra-Orthodox. Netanyahu instead met with Interior Minister Arye Dery, leader of the ultra-Orthodox Shas party, who demanded that the prime minister impose a general lockdown on the entire country instead of targeting hot spots.

     </p>
     <p>
      According to Dery, who represented the ultra-Orthodox mayors in the discussion, if the infection rate remains high, the cabinet should convene on Thursday, the day before the holiday is set to begin, and approve a closure over all of Israel.
     </p>
     <p>
      Dery claimed that Professionals have agreed that a targeted closure is not the solution and will not reduce the infection rate significantly.

      At the meeting with Netanyahu a nightly curfew and weekend closure were also discussed, but so far it seems this is unlikely.

      Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu decided to postpone the ministerial meeting scheduled to discuss the proposed lockdown on a number of municipalities, neighborhoods and two settlements, after ultra-Orthodox mayors sent him a letter saying they plan to cease cooperation with government authorities in the fight against the coronavirus in light of the expected decision.

       3:30 P.M. Haredi mayors inform Netanyahu they plan to cease cooperation with gov't over proposed lockdown
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The mayors of four predominantly ultra-Orthodox municipalities sent a letter Sunday to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, informing him that they plan to cease cooperation with government authorities in the fight against the coronavirus in light of an expected decision to impose a lockdown on their cities.
     </p>
     <p>
      The mayors of Bnei Brak, Elad, Betar Illit and the council head of Emanuel blamed Netanyahu in their letter of failing to hear them out, to examine alternatives they've proposed, or understand their plight, and charged that he has intentionally led Israel down a path that would lead to a lockdown of Haredi cities during the holidays.
      <em>
      </em>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Mayors wrote that since the coronavirus began to spread, they have been "at the forefront of the battle and leading the fight" against the virus. "We have all faced difficult struggles, at home and abroad, to take various steps to get patients out of our cities, to perform as many tests as possible, to maintain social distance, to locate and close places with potential for infection. We were able to change the equation by a considerable percentage, with personal initiative and a delicate fabric of rebuilding trust, in the face of the national erosion of trust and the implementation of the guidelines," they wrote.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, they claim that Netanyahu did not try to listen to the public and understand their plight. "You did not bother to ask, understand and learn what characterizes a significant section of the population in Israel ... Unfortunately, you did not send anyone on your behalf to hear directly our working methods, and the set of steps that will be taken and succeed in constant and respectful dialogue with the spiritual leadership of this public," they wrote.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Mayors concluded their letter by saying they would suspend cooperation with the government on everything related to the lockdown. Addressing Netanyahu, they wrote "we hereby inform you that the entire ultra-Orthodox public will not forget the injustice done to it. We will not forget who the man who signed with his hand, time and time again, on our becoming spreaders of diseases and enemies of the people, in the selective punishment of tens of thousands of families, members of the ultra-Orthodox sector."
     </p>
     <p>
      "The decisions you have made, time and time again, have been made in the absence of logic and health expectation and are sharply and clearly directed against the ultra-Orthodox public. We see you as the sole culprit for these punitive measures, for humiliating the dignity of tradition and our dignity as legitimate citizens of this country."

      An expert in infectious diseases and public health at the Health Ministry, Dr. Arik Hess, said that as of August 26, not even a single coronavirus case was diagnosed at protests calling for the resignation of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
     </p>
     <p>
      Hess provided the data at the request of Knesset coronavirus committee Chairwoman Yifat Shasha-Biton. The Health Ministry does not usually release data regarding COVID-19 infections, only publishing it once in July.
     </p>
     <p>
      Last week, coalition whip Miki Zohar of Likud claimed that the anti-government protests are solely responsible for the rise in new cases, but did not present any scientific proof backing his claim.
     </p>
     <p>
      The concentration of the coronavirus in the air determines the chance of infection. It diminishes in the open air, the virus' concentration diminishes, which significantly lowers the chance to get infected.
     </p>
     <p>
      To date, Israel's Health Ministry has not presented figures indicating outdoor infection.

      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Israel's coronavirus czar Ronni Gamzu will request that the coronavirus cabinet place a lockdown on a number of municipalities, neighborhoods and two settlements. If the cabinet approves the measure, the lockdowns will begin Monday and continue throughout the week.
     </p>
     <p>
      The lockdowns would be placed on the municipalities of Umm al-Fahm, Elad, Bnei Brak, Tira and Kafr Qasem. They would also be placed on the neighborhoods of Ramat Beit Shemesh Alef and Ramat Beit Shemesh Gimmel in Beit Shemesh and Isawiyah, al-Tur, Bab al-Zahara, Sheikh Jarrah and Wadi al-Joz in Jerusalem.
     </p>
     <p>
      Beitar Ilit and Immanuel, both settlements, would be locked down by military command.
     </p>
     <p>
      These places are considered "bright red" according to Gamzu's traffic-light plan, meaning that the coronavirus infection rates there are particularly high. At the end of the week's lockdown, the data will be analyzed and the locales' situation will be reconsidered.

       7:20 P.M. Virus hot spot Bnei Brak considering cutting off Health Ministry over proposed lockdown
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Bnei Brak Municipality is weighing cutting contact and ending all cooperation with the Health Ministry and the IDF's Home Front Command if a lockdown is placed on the city next week, Haaretz has learned.
     </p>
     <p>
      According to the recommendation within the municipality, if the lockdown is put in place, the city will close its coronavirus war room and "leave the keys" to the government. Mayor Avraham Rubinstein has not yet made a decision on the matter, and is expected to do so next week. Rubinstein has already notified a number of sources that the municipality will not accept the perspective lockdown with indifference, as it did during the first wave of the coronavirus.
     </p>
     <p>
      A source involved in the matter told Haaretz that Rabbi Gershon Edelstein will need to give his opinion on the subject. Edelstein, a leader in the ultra-Orthodox Lithuanian sect differs from his partner in leadership Rabbi Chaim Kanievsky in that he takes a more hardline stance in fighting the virus.
     </p>
     <p>
      Members of the Bnei Brak Municipality say that the Health Ministry is not listening to them, and that a lockdown in completely unnecessary.  The municipality believes that although the city is designated as red, with a high incidence of infection, its surrounding cities are not affected by it or designated as red themselves, therefore making a lockdown unnecessary.  Even though Bnei Brak is a red city, neighboring Petah Tikva is designated as yellow, as is Tel Aviv, and nearby Givat Shmuel is orange.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Bnei Brak has zero effect on the surrounding cities," a municipality source said. "The lockdown will only destroy the economy and education system, but not stop the infection rate, which will continue within households."
     </p>
     <p>
      Sources in the city said the major outbreaks of the virus in the city were caused by events and large weddings held there, some of which were hosted by rabbis and decision-makers. The municipality cannot, and sometimes does not want to, deal with these events, they said. (

       9:33 P.M. Netanyahu's son, coalition whip make baseless claims linking protests and pandemic
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s son, Yair, claimed in a tweet that the Shin Bet security service and the Health Ministry are keeping data on coronavirus infections at anti-government protests a secret, even though there is no factual basis for this claim.
     </p>
     <p>
      Earlier on Thursday, coalition whip Miki Zohar said the protests against Netanyahu were increasing the incidence of the coronavirus, providing no evidence to support this claim.
     </p>
     <p>
      So far, all the evidence shows a low risk of infection when people are outside, especially if they a wear mask and maintain social distancing.
     </p>
     <p>
      “We’ll wear masks, maintain distancing, avoid gatherings of more than 20 people and have our children study in capsules ... but none of it will help,” Zohar wrote on Twitter. “As long as these insane demonstrations with thousands of excited people shouting and sweating continue, incidence of the virus here will rise to heights we never dreamed of.”
     </p>
     <p>
      “There’s a price to the hatred and ‘high-mindedness’ of all the people supporting these demonstrations,” he added.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Black Flag protest group, one of the protests’ organizers, responded in a statement, “We’re witnessing a new campaign by the defendant and his toadies – that the demonstrations are to blame for the coronavirus. Israel leads the world in the number of coronavirus infections, but instead of trying to solve the problem, the defendant is doing what he always does – blaming others for his failures.”

       12:00 P.M. Health minister to call for full lockdowns on 8 high-risk cities
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Health Minister Yuli Edelstein intends to call for placing strict guidelines on locales designated as "red," or those with high rates of coronavirus infection, and particularly on eight cities with the highest incidence of the virus.
     </p>
     <p>
      The minister is calling for lockdowns for the cities, including barring the entrance and exit to and from the city, limiting residents' movement to 500 meters from their homes and limiting public activities. He is also calling for the closure of non-essential businesses, restaurants and schools, save for special education institutions and preschools.
     </p>
     <p>
      Edelstein is expected to call for nighttime curfews on other red cities, as well as closing restaurants, schools and non-essential businesses. (

      Ninety-eight new cases of COVID-19 were diagnosed over the last 24 hours in Gaza, the health ministry in the Strip said, raising the toll to 500 active cases.

     <p>
      Ministry officials warned that the continued rise in infections marks a great danger of the virus spreading across the Strip, and said the lockdown would continue in light of this.

       9:00 A.M. Health Ministry requests court end lab workers' strike
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Health Ministry requested an injunction against workers in state laboratories, who have been on strike since Sunday demanding a pay raise and better working conditions.  The court will rule on the request today.
     </p>
     <p>
      The ministry released a statement saying that it made its request after the two sides failed to reach an understanding in multiple talks with the lab workers' union and the Labor and Welfare Ministry. This was even after workers were offered a pay raise, more positions added in labs and compensation based on the number of coronavirus tests carried out, the ministry said.
     </p>
     <p>
      The ministry added that in parallel to these talks, they have staffed dozens of new positions in laboratories. Health Minister Yuli Edelstein said "It is unacceptable to wage a war to save lives from a pandemic during a strike. I hope that the event will end quickly for the best of the war against the virus."
     </p>
     <p>
      Professor Chezy Levy, Health Ministry director general, added that "With no solution and out of concern for patients, hospitals and clinics, we are forced to issue injunctions against a continued strike. Lab workers cannot be allowed to strike at this time." (

       11:40 P.M. Education Minister Gallant on tape : High-infection 'red cities' are a fiction and closing schools there is baseless
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Education Minister Yoav Gallant, who was unsuccessful in his bid to have the school year open on Tuesday throughout the country, including so-called "red zones" with the highest incidence of the coronavirus, was recorded on Wednesday as calling the concept of red zones a fiction.
     </p>
     <p>
      In a tape of remarks on a visit to the ultra-Orthodox Tel Aviv suburb of Bnei Brak that was broadcast Wednesday on Kan public television's Channel 11, Gallant attacked the coronavirus cabinet's decision to keep the schools closed in those areas, calling it "fundamentally mistaken."
     </p>
     <p>
      "I'm not a member of the coronavirus cabinet and therefore my vote wasn't counted, but I was opposed and I am opposed, as a matter of principle, to closing so-called red cities, which is also a fiction. It's a name and an invention that creates something that in reality doesn't exist.
     </p>
     <p>
      Prof. Ronni Gamzu, the director of government coronavirus policy, established a plan setting varying policies in local communities based on the incidence of COVID-19 cases and the rate of infection in each one. He has categorized the towns based on a range of four colors. Red communities are those with the highest rates. The plan was approved this week by the coronavirus cabinet.
     </p>
     <p>
      Gallant was critical of the approach, saying that the virus does not follow municipal boundaries and that the situation should be evaluated on a school-by school basis. (

      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Some 500 students tested positive for the coronavirus since the reopening of the school year in ultra-Orthodox yeshivas less than two weeks ago. The outbreak took place in several yeshivas that did not comply with the capsules model. However, in most of these yeshivas students do not leave the facility and are effectively quarantined there until the end of the Jewish holiday season in October.
     </p>
     <p>
      Rabbi Haim Kanievsky, considered a leading authority in the Haredi community, has authorized some yeshivas to not conduct COVID-19 testing as quarantining interferes with Torah study. The directive further deepened tensions between government health officials and religious leaders in the ultra-Orthodox community.

       Coronavirus czar: It’s not reasonable to open schools Tuesday in towns with high coronavirus levels

     <p>
      With the first day of school in Israel on Tuesday, the country's director of coronavirus policy, Prof. Ronni Gamzu, challenged Education Minister Yoav Gallant's stance that schools should open all over the country, including locations with a particularly high incidence of the virus.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is not reasonable to open schools in such places, he said, because it is impossible to avoid new cases in the process. Acknowledging his disagreement with Gallant, Gamzu, who is a former director general of the Health Ministry and a doctor by profession, said it doesn't look good for him to say one thing and for the education minister to say something else.
     </p>
     <p>
      "It could be that I am also wrong, but why take a gamble?" he said. As things are now headed, towns with the highest incidence of COVID-19 will have to be put under lockdown from time to time, he added.
     </p>
     <p>
      "We have a lot of experts who say I'm crazy for allowing the education system to open with 2,000 [new] cases a day. I do so with a heavy heart. I'm not gambling, but when it comes to the red cities [with the highest infection rates], there's no question," he said. The schools must not open.

      In a letter to Interior Minister Arye Dery, the director of public health at the Health Ministry, Sharon Alroy-Preis, noted that Egyptian authorities have declared southern Sinai, where beaches and others attractions popular with Israelis are located, "free of the coronavirus" although there are cases of the virus there. "The reported cases there are few and geographically dispersed," Elrae-Preis wrote, but she added that Egypt's reporting regarding cases of the virus may be deficient.

     <p>
      "It is clear that the [Egyptian] administration is interested maintaining these sites free of the coronavirus because they are an important source of revenue," she noted.

       10:00 A.M. Public lab workers strike deescalates at request of Health Ministry director general
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Israeli public health lab staffers will "return to the negotiating table" on Monday after "the personal request of the Health Ministry Director General, Prof. Hezi Levi, who called from the airport, before leaving with a delegation to Abu Dhabi, not to aggravate the strike today," Said Esther Admon, chairwoman of the Laboratory Workers' Union, on Monday.
     </p>
     <p>
      Levi "pledged that the Health Ministry would mediate and assist more actively and significantly in negotiations" with the Finance Ministry, in order to bring about a change in "their attitude towards us laboratory workers," continued Admon.
     </p>
     <p>
      Thus, the open-ended strike that started Sunday over poor working conditions and low wages, will not be exacerbated, and deciphering positive coronavirus tests will continue. (
